## Issues

When opening issues, please make sure that you include as much information as applicable.

* If your issue is an error, include a
  [stacktrace](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3988788/what-is-a-stack-trace-and-how-can-i-use-it-to-debug-my-application-errors)
  of what went wrong. This can be attached as a file, or uploaded to a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/).
* If your issue is a bug or otherwise unexpected behavior, explain what happened and what you expected to happen.
* If you're having trouble setting the bot up, we recommend joining [our Discord](https://discord.gg/hy2329fcTZ)

## Pull Request Policy

This PR policy has been adapted from the
[Quilt Mappings](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-mappings/blob/22w14a/CONTRIBUTING.md#guide-pull-requests) PR policy

1. ### Look at the code style
   Before you begin work on adding code to LilyBot, please spend some time looking through the rest of the code in
   LilyBot, and ensure in your Pull Request you follow the style as closely as you can.

   If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask in [our Discord](https://discord.gg/hy2329fcTZ).

2. ### Open your PR and wait for reviews
   Once you have forked LilyBot and opened a pull request, you will need to wait for reviews from other people. When you
   get reviews, try to thoughtfully address any concerns other people have. If you get confused, be sure to ask
   questions!

3. ### Merging your PR
   Once your PR has accumulated at least one review by a project member, it will be merged!
