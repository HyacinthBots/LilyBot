## Issues

When opening issues, please make sure that you include as much information as applicable.

* If your issue is an error, include a
[stacktrace](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3988788/what-is-a-stack-trace-and-how-can-i-use-it-to-debug-my-application-errors)
of what went wrong. This can be attached as a file, or uploaded to a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/).
* If your issue is a bug or otherwise unexpected behavior, explain what happened and what you expected to happen.
* If you're having trouble setting the bot up, we recommend joining [our discord](https://discord.gg/hy2329fcTZ) as we will be able to provide more dynamic support there.

## Pull Requests

We love to see when people contribute to the project! Our [Issues Page](https://github.com/IrisShaders/LilyBot/issues) often has a list of features that need to be implemented. However, you'll need to read the following guidelines:

### Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

By submitting changes to the repository, you are hereby agreeing that:

* Your contributions will be licensed irrevocably under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/).
* Your contributions are of your own work and free of legal restrictions (such as patents and copyrights) or other issues
which would pose issues for inclusion or distribution under the above license.

If you do not agree with these terms, please do not submit contributions to this repository. If you have any questions
about these terms, feel free to join [our discord](https://discord.gg/hy2329fcTZ) and ask any questions that you may have.

### Code Style

When contributing source code changes to the project, ensure that you make consistent use of the code style guidelines
used throughout the codebase (which closely follow the standard Java code style guidelines).
These are not explicitly enforced, but are generally welcome.

We have no plans to use automatic word detection, since it can easily have false positives and is generally more annoying
and intrusive than helpful. Any Pull Requests that attempt to do this will be closed.

### Making a Pull Request

Your Pull Request should include a brief description of the changes it makes and link to any open issues which it
resolves. You should also ensure that your code follows the outlined guidance above.

When adding new commands to the project, thoroughly explain why you would like said command to be added to the bot. It's recommended to first draft any such command in [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/jQJnav2jPu).

**All new pull requests should target the [develop branch](https://github.com/IrisShaders/LilyBot/tree/develop).**
