# LilyBot

## Links
* **Visit [our website](https://irisshaders.net) for downloads and pretty screenshots!**
* Visit [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/jQJnav2jPu) to chat about Iris projects (such as LilyBot) and get support!
* Visit [my Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/coderbot) to support the continued development of Iris projects!

### Why?
* Late in August 2021, Discord.py was discontinued. This is previously what the Iris Project's Discord bot was written in, So [NoComment](https://github.com/NoComment1105), [Miss Corruption](https://github.com/Miss-Corruption), [Maxigator](https://github.com/Maxigator) and [chalkyjeans](https://github.com/chalkyjeans) took on the task of rewriting the bot in JDA.

### How can I use LilyBot in my own server!?
