### Why?
* Late in August 2021, Discord.py was discontinued. This is previously what the Iris Project's Discord bot was written in, So [NoComment](https://github.com/NoComment1105), [Miss Corruption](https://github.com/Miss-Corruption), [Maxigator](https://github.com/Maxigator) and [chalkyjeans](https://github.com/chalkyjeans) took on the task of rewriting the bot in JDA.

### How can I use LilyBot in my own server!?
Follow the in-depth [installation guide](https://github.com/IrisShaders/LilyBot/blob/main/docs/installation-guide.md).

### What was used to write this bot?
* JDA: https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA
* JDA Chewtils: https://github.com/Chew/JDA-Chewtils (well [chalkyjeans' fork](https://github.com/chalkyjeans/JDA-Chewtils) of it)
* Logback: https://github.com/qos-ch/logback
* dotenv: https://github.com/cdimascio/dotenv-java
* Github-API: https://github.com/hub4j/github-api

#### What do each of these do?
* JDA: The Java API for Discord
* JDA Chewtils: A forked fork of JDA Utils for useful implementations
* Logback: Removes some fake errors
* dotenv: For accessing `.env` files that contain the bots sensitive data
* Github-API: The API for GitHub commands. Helps to produce the GitHub Repo, Issue and Profile embeds
