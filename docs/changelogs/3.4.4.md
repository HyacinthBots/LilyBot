# LilyBot 3.4.4

This is a minor bug fix release with an additional feature.
The full changelog can be found below.

* Removed deprecated use of `mainClassName` in the buildscript
* Clean up the `KotlinCompile` task to not have the unneeded extra stuff
* Clean up the permission check function to make it a little cleaner
* Added a /tag-edit command to allow users to edit tags, rather than deleting and re making them.
* Allow the /tag-list command to create pages, to avoid errors due to the embed body being too long
