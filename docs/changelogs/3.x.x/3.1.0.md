# LilyBot 3.1.0 Changelog

This update includes a whole ton of new features as well as some changes to some longstanding features.
The full changelog can be found below.

* Fix commands in DMs causing errors.
* Add a `/nickname-request` command to request a nickname change.
Moderators can either confirm or deny this request and provide a reason.
* Improve logging for the '/say' command.
* Fix mods not being invited to thread when a support team config isn't set.
* Add commands to lock and unlock either the whole server or a specific channel.
* Switch the log uploading system to utilize [https://mclo.gs/](https://mclo.gs/).
* Add a 'tags' system to set and display guild-specific embeds.
Please note that **Custom Commands are now deprecated** and will be fully removed in the next sizeable release.
* The functions for interacting with the database no longer make use of string mapping.
* We now make use of [detekt](https://detekt.dev/) to check for any potential issues with the codebase and
  standardize formatting. Things are much tidier as a result.
* The report system now includes user confirmation to avoid needless mod pings.
* Dependencies have been updated.
