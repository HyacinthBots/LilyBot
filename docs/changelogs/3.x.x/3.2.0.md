# LilyBot 3.2.0 Changelog

This update adds thread ownership, better database management, and removes custom commands.
The full changelog can be found below.

* Newlines now work properly in the say command.
* Attachment logging now uses `media.discordapp.net` as deleted images are cached there longer.
* Invalid inputs for the `days` argument on the ban command are now checked.
* A new thread ownership system has been added. This included the `thread transfer` command.
The person a support thread was created for can now use the thread management commands.
* The tag system has been cleaned up, and now has a user argument to ping someone.
* We've documented a lot of our code. Things should now be more readable.
* The user is now mentioned in join logging embeds.
* Say has been rewritten to support embed colors and removal of the embed timestamp. It no longer works in DM channels.
* If Lily leaves a guild, any data from that guild will now be deleted after a month.
* You can now use a URL in the GitHub commands, instead of just "Org/Repository"
* **Custom commands have been fully removed.**
