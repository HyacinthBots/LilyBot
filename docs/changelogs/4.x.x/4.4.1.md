# LilyBot 4.4.1

A small update to fix some bugs with logging and warn auto-punishments

You can find the full changelog below.

Fix:
* The timeout embed for warnings over 3 strikes, no longer contains the user object, instead the strike count
* Timeout embeds no longer show when auto-punishments is disabled
* The moderation config logging embed now shows all options, instead of missing quick timeout length and auto punishments
