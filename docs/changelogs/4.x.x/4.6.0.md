# LilyBot 4.6.0

This update fully rewrites thread inviting and fixes several bugs. 
The support channel system is now deprecated (replaced by auto-threading) and will be removed in version 4.7.0.
If you have a support channel, it's been automatically migrated to an auto-threaded channel.
You can find the full changelog below.

New:
* Auto-threading, which allows you to configure Lily to create a thread on any message sent in a channel
* Role hierarchy checks in nickname request to prevent errors
* Automatic command documentation generation

Change:
* Switch a lot of throwing functions to their nullable variants to reduce errors
* Remove old mapping extension configuration files
* Switch to using KordEx modals, hopefully providing a more stable modal experience 
* Switch from using a TOML file to generate our docs to our new [doc-generator](https://github.com/HyacinthBots/doc-generator)

Fix:
* Commit hash and information being wrong
* Member counts not working (for like the 15th time)
* Reminders being broken (for like the 15th time)
* Auto-punishment on warn command not working correctly
