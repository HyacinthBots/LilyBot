# LilyBot 4.1.1

This release cleans up quite a few errors and small missing features from the 4.1.0 release. 
It also temporarily removes reminders as they are completely broken and need to be re-written.
Lastly, it removes the KordEx Mappings extension as Lily is no longer a Minecraft-focused bot. 

Change:
* remove reminders
* remove mappings extension
* switch to xml for logback
* add a jump button to edit logging
* no longer log edited messages from bots

Fix:
* message edits going to member log
* Lily's online embed in production
* message attachments on message edit and delete logs
