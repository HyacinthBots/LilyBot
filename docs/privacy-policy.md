# LilyBot Privacy Policy

For an overview of LilyBot's features and capabilities, please visit our [README.md](https://github.com/HyacinthBots/LilyBot/blob/main/README.md).

The developers of LilyBot are not lawyers and do not have the resources to hire lawyers. We have, to the best of our ability, written this document clearly, concisely, and accurately. If you have any questions, please see the `Contact & Data Access or Removal` sections.

That said, we have created LilyBot in a way to utilize the least possible amount of data storage required. All data we collect is directly linked to various features, and data collected by or provided to LilyBot will never be sold or provided to a third party. The only people with access to your data are our hosting provider and, under certain circumstances, the developers. This is both for ethical and infrastructure reasons.

## Automatically Collected Data

The following data is automatically collected by LilyBot.
- **Thread Data** is stored when LilyBot creates a thread for a support channel. The owner of the thread is stored, allowing the owner to use thread commands.
- **Guild Leave Data** is stored when LilyBot leaves a guild. It contains LilyBot's time of departure and allows us to delete old data associated with a guild.

## Manually Provided Data

The following data is not automatically collected by LilyBot and will only be stored when manually provided, for example through a slash command.
- **Configuration Data** includes things like the channel set for moderation logs or the moderator role.
- **Reminders Data** includes data about reminders that have been set by users.
- **Role Menu Data** contains things like the IDs of roles attached to the menus.
- **Tag Data** holds the tags that have been created by guild owners for their guild.
- **Thread Data** contains support threads, or threads transferred to a new user by the original owner They are stored to allow the use of the thread archive and rename commands.
- **Warning Data** is a list of users and the number of warning strikes they have accumulated in each guild.

## Data Retention

- **Thread Data** is checked when the bot restarts. Data associated with threads that have been inactive for more than 7 days is deleted from LilyBot's database.

- **Guild Data** is checked when the bot restarts. Guild Leave Data is used to delete all data from a guild that LilyBot left over 30 days prior.

## Contact & Data Access or Removal
For questions or requests for access or removal of personal data, you may email us at hyacinthbots@outlook.com. You may also contact either NoComment#6411 or tempest#451 on Discord.

Please note that, under normal circumstances, the lead developers of the bot do not have access to data that LilyBot stores. If requests are made, we will need to contact our hosting provider.
