## The Warn command

The warn command in LilyBot operates on a strike based system. 

If the user requires a warning, and the command is run by an actioning moderator, the user will be given 1 (one) strike.
The strikes all hold the same weight, until you reach 3 strikes when sanctions for too many warning come into play. 
Below you can find a table of the sanctions that are incurred when certain point values are hit.

| Points   | Sanction                                                                                     |
|:---------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | None. This is the first warning. It would be hard to punish on warning 1                     |
| 2        | None. The user will be given a reminder in their notification about being careful            |
| 3        | 12 hour timeout. The user already been told twice, therefore it is time to enforce sanctions |
| 3+       | 3 day timeout. How many times :/                                                             |
