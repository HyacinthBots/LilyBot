**Ray Tracing**
Ray tracing refers to a family of techniques revolving around sending rays out into the world and then doing things with them. Common usage of ray tracing techniques include: screen space reflections on things like water (specifically ray marching) and finding hit locations in shooter games (specifically ray casting).
**Path Tracing**
Path tracing is an advanced type of ray tracing which can be used to create lighting which behaves almost exactly like real life. It calculates paths (hence the name) that light can take from a source to your eyes.
**RTX**
RTX is Nvidia's line of graphics cards which have hardware dedicated to doing a lot of ray tracing very quickly. AMD's newest graphics cards also have equivalent hardware, but they don't have a fancy name for it. Minecraft Java Edition doesn't currently have the capabilities required to use this hardware though, so while all techniques mentioned above can be used in Java Edition, they will run at normal speed instead of turbo speed."""
