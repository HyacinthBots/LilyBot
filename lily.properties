rule.child.9.title = Rule 9
rule.child.1.desc = Be decent to one another. We're all human. Any and all forms of bigotry, harassment, doxxing, exclusionary, or otherwise abusive behavior will not be tolerated. Excessive rudeness, impatience, and hostility are not welcome. Do not rage out or make personal attacks against other people. Do not encourage users to brigade/raid other communities.
rule.child.2.desc = Keep chat clean. Do not spam text, images, user mentions, emojis, reactions, or anything else. Do not post offensive, obscene, politically charged, or sexually explicit content. Avoid using vulgar language and excessive profanity. Use English at all times in public channels.
rule.child.3.desc = Keep discussion on-topic. This server is focused around Iris. General chatter unrelated to Iris is best kept to other Discord communities or to DMs.
rule.child.4.desc = Understand that support is not guaranteed. Support will be provided on a best-effort basis.
rule.child.5.desc = Do not ask for support on compiling Iris, and refrain from providing this support. There is sufficient information for people who know what they're doing to compile the mod themselves without help. If we would like you to use a given version of the mod, we will give you a compiled build of that version.
rule.child.6.desc = No links to executable files or JAR files. Uploading or directly linking to executable files is not allowed without prior approval.
rule.child.7.desc = Refrain from sending unsolicited pings and direct messages. Pings and DMs can be annoying to deal with, so please avoid using them unless they are necessary. Use pings in replies with discretion as well. Unsolicited support requests made with pings and DMs are a big no.
rule.child.8.desc = Adhere to the Discord Terms of Service. I'd like to avoid getting this community banned. No piracy! Absolutely no support will be provided for people running cracked versions of the game. Providing support for these people counts as a rule violation!

We do not provide support for these forks or ports, and they've been a big source of headaches for our support team. Trying to circumvent this rule by telling people to move to DMs or to non-support channels to talk about these forks or ports is still a violation of this rule. This rule was created because people constantly recommended broken Iris forks to people who probably shouldn't be using them in the support channels.

rtx.help = Informs the user about the differences between Ray Tracing, Path Tracing, and RTX.
rtx.title = What are Ray Tracing, Path Tracing, and RTX?
rtx.desc = **Ray Tracing**\nRay tracing refers to a family of techniques revolving around sending rays out into the world and then doing things with them. Common usage of ray tracing techniques include: screen space reflections on things like water (specifically ray marching) and finding hit locations in shooter games (specifically ray casting).\n\n**Path Tracing**\nPath tracing is an advanced type of ray tracing which can be used to create lighting which behaves almost exactly like real life. It calculates paths (hence the name) that light can take from a source to your eyes.\n\n**RTX**\nRTX is Nvidia's line of graphics cards which have hardware dedicated to doing a lot of ray tracing very quickly. AMD's newest graphics cards also have equivalent hardware, but they don't have a fancy name for it. Minecraft Java Edition doesn't currently have the capabilities required to use this hardware though, so while all techniques mentioned above can be used in Java Edition, they will run at normal speed instead of turbo speed.
